# CprE Forever Custom ComfyUI Nodes

This is a subset of nodes for ComfyUI that I made just for my own workflow. The nodes support Flux (single conditioning, no negatives) and
are just a way of minimizing the noodles. There's no real journey to be made here, just anything that helps me get through the day.

In the future I might put together a more comprehensive list of "global" nodes that are useful for everyone, but right now this is just
a playground for me.

If you found yourself here and don't know how to install custom nodes for ComfyUI, then that's a sad place to be in. All others are
free to try out and use.

I make no guarantees as to the ability of these and if something is broken then don't use it.
